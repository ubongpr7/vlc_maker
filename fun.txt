In the bustling halls of FUTA, Prosper sat quietly, 
as he always did, minding his own world. But that world changed one fateful day during a 300-level course. 
She walked in—Eniola, her beauty radiating through the room like sunshine. 
Her smile was the kind that made time stop, a smile that pierced deep into Prosper’s heart. 
He had never felt anything like it before.
For years, Prosper had avoided love, never letting anyone close enough. 
But Eniola was different. Her smile haunted him, keeping him up at night. 
He couldn't stop thinking about her, no matter how hard he tried. 
The more he saw her, the more he knew—his heart wasn’t his anymore.
He kept his feelings hidden, too shy to speak. 
He'd sit in class, stealing glances, 
while his mind raced with thoughts of her. 
Prosper—no, Ubong—wasn’t the type to fall easily. 
But Eniola’s laughter, her kindness, the way she made everyone around her feel at ease, 
all of it drew him in deeper. 
She was more than beautiful—she was captivating, magnetic in her own quiet way.
Eniola, or Beatrice as her friends called her, 
noticed Prosper too. His quiet presence intrigued her. 
She’d catch him looking at her, and a small smile would escape her lips. 
It wasn’t long before she found herself hoping for those silent moments of connection.
One day, after class, she made her move. 
“Is this seat taken?” she asked, sitting beside him before he could answer. 
Prosper’s heart pounded, but he managed a quiet, “No, please.”
They sat in comfortable silence before Eniola broke it with a soft laugh. 
“You know, I’ve seen you around. There’s something peaceful about you.” 
Prosper smiled, his heart swelling with warmth. From that moment, 
they began to talk. It was easy, natural. The conversations flowed, 
and with each word shared, their connection grew.
Years of unspoken feelings, sleepless nights, and quiet longing finally turned into something real. 
Prosper’s heart, once stolen by a smile, now found its home in Eniola’s gentle embrace.
